Emotion Classification with BERT and LoRA
This project fine-tunes a BERT model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for the task of emotion classification on the Emotion dataset. LoRA is type of PEFT technique. 
The goal is to adapt a pre-trained BERT model and to increase its accuracy in classifying the text into one of six emotions: joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, or surprise.

Project Overview
Key Steps
Load and Evaluate the Original BERT Model:

Load a pre-trained BERT model and evaluate its performance on the Emotion dataset.

Fine-Tune BERT Using LoRA:

Apply LoRA to the BERT model to efficiently fine-tune it on the Emotion dataset.

Perform Inference and Compare Results:

Evaluate the fine-tuned model’s performance and compare it to the original model.

Requirements
To run this project, you’ll need the following Python libraries:

pip install transformers datasets evaluate peft scikit-learn

Run the Code:
Open the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script and run the cells sequentially.

Fine-Tune the Model:
The code will:

Load the BERT model and Emotion dataset.

Fine-tune the model using LoRA.

Evaluate the fine-tuned model and compare it to the original.

Save the Model:
The fine-tuned model and tokenizer will be saved to the directory fine-tuned-lora-bert-model.

Key Files
Notebook/Code: Contains the implementation for loading, fine-tuning, and evaluating the model.

Fine-Tuned Model: Saved in the fine-tuned-lora-bert-model directory.

README: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Results
After fine-tuning, the model’s performance on the Emotion dataset is evaluated. The results are compared to the original BERT model to measure improvement.


Original Model Accuracy: 1.891
Fine-Tuned Model Accuracy: 1.004
Improvement: 0.887

Why BERT and LoRA?
BERT: A powerful transformer model designed for sequence classification tasks. Its bidirectional attention mechanism makes it ideal for understanding context in text.

LoRA: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that reduces the number of trainable parameters, making fine-tuning faster and more memory-efficient.

Future Work
Experiment with other PEFT techniques like Adapters or Prefix Tuning.

Try different models like RoBERTa or DistilBERT.

Use advanced evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
